For the AP CS A exam, you only need to know how to use the following String methods.  All of the String method descriptions are included in the |AP CS A Reference Sheet| that you get during the exam so you don't have to memorize these.


    -  **int length()** method returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters like punctuation.

    -  **String substring(int from, int to)** method returns a new string with the characters in the current string starting with the character at the ``from`` index and ending at the character *before* the ``to`` index (if the ``to`` index is specified, and if not specified it will contain the rest of the string).

    -  **int indexOf(String str)** method searches for the string ``str`` in the current string and returns the index of the beginning of ``str`` in the current string or -1 if it isn't found.

    -  **int compareTo(String other)** returns a negative value if the current string is less than the ``other`` string alphabetically, 0 if they have the same characters in the same order, and a positive value if the current string is greater than the ``other`` string alphabetically.

    -  **boolean equals(String other)** returns true when the characters in the current string are the same as the ones in the ``other`` string.  This method is inherited from the Object class, but is **overriden** which means that the String class has its own version of that method.



Summary
-------------------

- **index** - A number that represents the position of a character in a string.  The first character in a string is at index 0.
- **length** - The number of characters in a string.
- **substring** - A new string that contains a copy of part of the original string.

- A String object has index values from 0 to length â€“ 1. Attempting to access indices outside this range will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

- String objects are **immutable**, meaning that String methods do not change the String object. Any method that seems to change a string actually creates a new string.

- The following String methods and constructors, including what they do and when they are used, are part of the |AP CS A Reference Sheet| that you can use during the exam:

  - **String(String str)** : Constructs a new String object that represents the same sequence of characters as str.

  - **int length()** : returns the number of characters in a String object.

  - **String substring(int from, int to)** : returns the substring beginning at index from  and ending at index (to -1).

  - **String substring(int from)** : returns substring(from, length()).

  - **int indexOf(String str)** : searches for str in the current string and returns the index of the first occurrence of str; returns -1 if not found.

  - **boolean equals(String other)** : returns true if this (the calling object) is equal to other; returns false otherwise.

  - **int compareTo(String other)** : returns a value < 0 if this is less than other; returns zero if this is equal to other; returns a value > 0 if this is greater than other.

- ``str.substring(index, index + 1)`` returns a single character at index in string str.
