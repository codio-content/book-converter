   80/20 rule
      Given a typical application where there is a collection of
      records and a series of search operations for records,
      the 80/20 rule is an empirical observation that
      80% of the record accessess typically go to 20% of the records.
      The exact values varies between data collections, and is related
      to the concept of :term:`locality of reference`.
