In our simple example, it was easy for us to create the HTML and JSON
fixtures needed for our tests, because we wrote the app that generates
the HTML views and the data structures that get translated to JSON.  But
often when developing SPAs or even when calling external services from
your server code you need to ``exercise'' the remote service's API in
order to understand how to call it and to get ``live'' examples of real
data it might return, so that you can create fixtures and write the code
to parse that data.  Screencast~\ref{exploring_restful_apis} shows
how to use some tools that can help.
