In our simple example, it was easy for us to create the HTML and JSON fixtures needed for our tests, because we wrote the app that generates the HTML views and the data structures that get translated to JSON.  But often when developing SPAs or even when calling external services from your server code you need to “exercise” the remote service's API in order to understand how to call it and to get “live” examples of real data it might return, so that you can create fixtures and write the code to parse that data.  Screencast exploring_restful_apis shows how to use some tools that can help.
