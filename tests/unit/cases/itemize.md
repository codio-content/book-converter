*  One concept at a time.
We break down topics that give beginners trouble into a series of small steps, so that they can exercise each new concept in isolation before continuing.

*  Balance of Java and concepts.
The book is not primarily about Java; it uses code examples to demonstrate computer science.
Most chapters start with language features and end with concepts.
