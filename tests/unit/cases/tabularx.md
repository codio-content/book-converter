|**Customer Need**||Included brief statement of customer problem and scope of project|Not clear what the customer really wanted or what problem the group is<br/>trying to solve<br/><br/>|
|**Technical Discussion**|Clearly conveyed some technical details of the app.  Discussed a<br/>technical challenge in an understandable way|Attempted to talk about technical aspects of app, mostly successfully.<br/>Either no technical challenge or not able to clearly convey technical<br/>topics|Little or no technical coverage of their app.  Implementation details<br/>are unclear.<br/><br/>|
|**Customer Interaction**|Clearly describe relationship with customer. Talk about goods, bads, and<br/>what was learned|Talked about customer interaction to some extent|Mentioned customer interaction, but no details about the experience<br/><br/>|
|**Development Practices**|Explained clearly their implementation of agile in their iterations.<br/>Reflect on what went well and what did not.  Had a method to taking on<br/>iterations.|Briefly explain development practices.  Give an idea of approaches they<br/>took to iterations/Agile, but don't reflect on their effectiveness|Doesn't appear they took methodology seriously, and/or no evidence of<br/>concrete implementation of agile principles<br/><br/>|


|**Approach**|**Technologies \& Tools**|**Main Pros**|**Main Cons**<br/>  ||
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Responsive or mobile-only Web site|HTML5, CSS, JavaScript; any development environment|Portable across devices, so no need to develop/maintain multiple<br/>  versions; updates automatically|May not show up in searches; not listed in app stores; may lack<br/>  access to certain platform hardware features, such as<br/>  biometrics-based identification<br/>  ||
|Native app|Java (Android) or Objective-C (iOS) with mobile-specific IDE|Best performance; guaranteed access to all platform hardware features|Must rely on users to download and install updates; supporting<br/>  multiple platforms requires maintaining multiple codebases<br/><br/>  ||
|Wrapped app|HTML5, CSS, JavaScript; framework such as PhoneGap required to<br/>  “package” app for distribution|Portable, develop with any IDE, but still get installable app that<br/>  appears in app stores and searches|Must rely on users to download and install updates<br/>  ||
