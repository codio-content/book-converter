Either no technical challenge or not able to clearly convey technical topics|Little or no technical coverage of their app.  Implementation details are unclear.|

|**Approach**|**Technologies \& Tools**|**Main Pros**|**Main Cons**||
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Responsive or mobile-only Web site|HTML5, CSS, JavaScript; any development environment|Portable across devices, so no need to develop/maintain multiple versions; updates automatically|May not show up in searches; not listed in app stores; may lack access to certain platform hardware features, such as biometrics-based identification||
|Native app|Java (Android) or Objective-C (iOS) with mobile-specific IDE|Best performance; guaranteed access to all platform hardware features|Must rely on users to download and install updates; supporting multiple platforms requires maintaining multiple codebases||
|Wrapped app|HTML5, CSS, JavaScript; framework such as PhoneGap required to “package” app for distribution|Portable, develop with any IDE, but still get installable app that appears in app stores and searches|Must rely on users to download and install updates||
