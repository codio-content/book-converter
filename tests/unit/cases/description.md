**Chapters 1--4:**



We reordered the material in Chapter 1 to present a more interesting balance of theory and practice.

Chapters 2--3 are much cleaner now too.

Methods are now presented in a single chapter, along with additional in-depth examples.



**Chapters 5--8:**



These chapters received the most attention.

We rearranged the content, added many examples and new figures, and removed unnecessary details.

Strings are covered earlier (before arrays) so that readers can apply them to loop problems.

The material on recursion is now a chapter, and we added new sections to explain binary numbers and CodingBat problems.
