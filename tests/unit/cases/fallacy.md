## 100% test coverage with all tests passing means no bugs.
 There are many reasons this statement can be false. Complete test coverage says nothing about the quality of the individual tests.  As well, some bugs may require passing a certain value as a method argument (for example, to trigger a divide-by-zero error), and control flow testing often cannot reveal such a bug. There may be bugs in the interaction between your app and an external service such as TMDb; stubbing out the service so you can perform local testing might mask such bugs.
