  In 1958 he helped design ALGOL,
  \index{ALGOL|textit}%
  which has influenced virtually every imperative programming language
  including C and Java.  To avoid FORTRAN's
  syntactic and semantic problems, ALGOL was the first language
  described in terms of a formal grammar, the eponymous
  \w[Backus-Naur_Form]{Backus-Naur form} (named for Turing award
  \index{Backus,John|textit}%
  \index{Backus-Naur form|textit}%
  winner Jim Backus and his colleague Peter Naur).
