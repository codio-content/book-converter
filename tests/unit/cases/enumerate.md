1. Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.
2. Add a print statement that displays a second message after the “Hello, World!”. Say something witty like, “How are you?” Compile and run the program again.
3. Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again. The new comment should not affect the result.



Recall that the hope for plan-and-document methods is to make software engineering as predictable in budget and schedule as civil engineering. Remarkably, user stories, points, and velocity correspond to <i>seven</i> major tasks of the plan-and-document methodologies. They include:


1. Requirements Elicitation
2. Requirements Documentation
3. Cost Estimation
4. Scheduling and Monitoring Progress


These are done up front for the Waterfall model and at the beginning of each major iteration for the Spiral and RUP models. As requirements change over time,  these items above imply other tasks:


5. Change Management for Requirements, Cost, and Schedule
6. Ensuring Implementation Matches Requirement Features


Finally, since accuracy of the budget estimate and the schedule is vital to the success of the plan-and-document process, there is another task not found in BDD:


7. Risk Analysis and Management


The hope is that by imagining all the risks to the budget and schedule in advance, the project can make plans to avoid or overcome them.
