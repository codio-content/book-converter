% \begin{sidebar}{High Cost of Hardware Change}
%Civil engineering is often used as an analogy to computer engineering. The high cost of upgrading hardware can be illustrated by the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge in the Bay Area. The 2 mile high rise structure cost \$70M in 1967 when it was opened, with 6 lanes (3 each direction) in the high-rise section connecting to 4 lanes (2 each direction) on the flat section. Widening the flat portion from 4 lanes to 6 lanes in 2003 cost \$200M. Accounting for inflation, in constant dollars adding two lanes to the flat road cost half as much as building a whole bridge!

Unlike hardware, software is expected to grow and evolve over time. Whereas hardware designs must be
declared finished before they can be manufactured and shipped, initial software designs can easily be shipped and later upgraded over time. Basically, the cost of upgrade in the field is astronomical for hardware and affordable for software.
