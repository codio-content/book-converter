## Customers who confuse mock-ups with completed features.


As a developer, this pitfall may seem ridiculous to you.  But
nontechnical customers sometimes have difficulty distinguishing a highly
polished digital mock-up from a working feature!  The solution is simple: use
paper-and-pencil techniques such as hand-drawn sketches and storyboards to
reach agreement with the customer---there can be no doubt that such
Lo-Fi mockups represent *proposed* rather than implemented
functionality.
