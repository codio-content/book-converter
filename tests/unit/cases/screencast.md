**Screencast: Inspecting the ID and Class attributes**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/X5ArSbUea_o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


CSS uses ___selector notations___ such as **div#***name* to indicate a **div** element whose **id** is *name* and **div.***name* to indicate a **div** element with class *name*. Only one element in an HTML document can have a given **id**, whereas many elements (even of different tag types) can share the same **class**. All three aspects of an element---its tag type, its **id** (if it has one), and its **class** attributes (if it has any)---can be used to identify an element as a candidate for visual formatting.

**Screencast: Interpolation into views using Haml**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yX1tMdBuG3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


In a Haml template, lines beginning with **%** expand into the corresponding HTML opening tag, with no closing tag needed since Haml uses indentation to determine structure.  Ruby-like hashes following a tag become HTML attributes. Lines \mbox{**--beginning with a dash**} are executed as Ruby code with the result discarded, and lines \mbox{**=beginning with an equals sign**} are executed as Ruby code with the result interpolated into the HTML output.
