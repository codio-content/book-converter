**Screencast: Inspecting the ID and Class attributes**

CSS uses ___selector notations___ such as <b>div#</b><i>name</i> to indicate a <b>div</b> element whose <b>id</b> is <i>name</i> and <b>div.</b><i>name</i> to indicate a <b>div</b> element with class <i>name</i>. Only one element in an HTML document can have a given <b>id</b>, whereas many elements (even of different tag types) can share the same <b>class</b>. All three aspects of an element---its tag type, its <b>id</b> (if it has one), and its <b>class</b> attributes (if it has any)---can be used to identify an element as a candidate for visual formatting.

**Screencast: Interpolation into views using Haml**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yX1tMdBuG3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


In a Haml template, lines beginning with <b>%</b> expand into the corresponding HTML opening tag, with no closing tag needed since Haml uses indentation to determine structure.  Ruby-like hashes following a tag become HTML attributes. Lines \mbox{<b>--beginning with a dash</b>} are executed as Ruby code with the result discarded, and lines \mbox{<b>=beginning with an equals sign</b>} are executed as Ruby code with the result interpolated into the HTML output.
