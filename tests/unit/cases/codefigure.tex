  \js{} notation for object literals, that is, objects you specify by
  enumerating their properties and values explicitly.
  If the property name is a legal \js{} variable name, quotes can be
  omitted or the idiomatic dot-notation shortcut (lines 13--14) can be
  used, although quotes are always required around all strings when an
  object is expressed in JSON format.
  Since objects can contain other
  objects, hierarchical data structures can be built (line 5) and
  traversed (lines 13--15).
