\begin{enumerate}
\item Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.

\item Add a print statement that displays a second message after the ``Hello, World!''.
Say something witty like, ``How are you?''
Compile and run the program again.

\item Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again.
The new comment should not affect the result.
\end{enumerate}
