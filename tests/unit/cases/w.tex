Many SaaS apps, including those based on Rails,
follow the \w{Model-View-Controller} (MVC) architectural
pattern. In MVC, Models deal with the
app's \w[Web_resource]{resources} such as users or blog posts,
Views present
information to the user via the browser, and Controllers  map the
user's browser actions to application code.
