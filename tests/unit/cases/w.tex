Many SaaS apps, including those based on Rails,
follow the \w{Model-View-Controller} (MVC) architectural
pattern. In MVC, Models deal with the
app's \w[Web_resource]{resources} such as users or blog posts,
Views present
information to the user via the browser, and Controllers  map the
user's browser actions to application code.

\begin{itemize}
\item Using \w[Ajax (programming)]{AJAX}, or Asynchronous \js{} And XML,
\js{} code can make
HTTP requests to a Web server \emph{without} triggering a page
reload.  The information in the response can then be used to modify page
elements in place, giving a richer and often more responsive
user experience than traditional
Web pages.  Rails partials and controller actions
can be readily used to handle AJAX interactions.
\end{itemize}
