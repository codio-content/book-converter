Many SaaS apps, including those based on Rails, follow the ___Model-View-Controller___ (MVC) architectural pattern. In MVC, Models deal with the app's ___resources___ such as users or blog posts, Views present information to the user via the browser, and Controllers  map the user's browser actions to application code.



* Using ___AJAX___, or Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, JavaScript code can make HTTP requests to a Web server without triggering a page reload.  The information in the response can then be used to modify page elements in place, giving a richer and often more responsive user experience than traditional Web pages.  Rails partials and controller actions can be readily used to handle AJAX interactions.
