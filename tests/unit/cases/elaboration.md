## Formal specification languages
Formal specification languages such as Alloy or Z allow the project manager to write executable requirements, which makes it easier to validate the implementation. Not surprisingly, the cost is both a more difficult document to write and usually a much longer requirements document to read. The advantage is both precision in the specification and the potential to automatically generate tests cases or even use formal methods for verification of correctness (see Section sec:TDD_P_and_D).
