 JavaScript notation for object literals, that is, objects you specify by enumerating their properties and values explicitly. If the property name is a legal JavaScript variable name, quotes can be omitted or the idiomatic dot-notation shortcut (lines 13--14) can be used, although quotes are always required around all strings when an object is expressed in JSON format. Since objects can contain other objects, hierarchical data structures can be built (line 5) and traversed (lines 13--15).

 A simple class definition in Ruby showing that explicit getter and setter methods are the only way to access instance variables from outside a class, and that Ruby provides shortcuts (lines 19--20) that avoid having to define every accessor method explicitly.  Rather than distinguish “private” vs. “public” instance and class variables, one simply provides public accessor methods (read-only, write-only, or read/write) for state that should be publicly visible.
