 JavaScript notation for object literals, that is, objects you specify by enumerating their properties and values explicitly. If the property name is a legal JavaScript variable name, quotes can be omitted or the idiomatic dot-notation shortcut (lines 13--14) can be used, although quotes are always required around all strings when an object is expressed in JSON format. Since objects can contain other objects, hierarchical data structures can be built (line 5) and traversed (lines 13--15).
