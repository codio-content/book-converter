a) Study of software projects found that 53\% of projects exceeding
their budgets by a factor of 2.9 and overshot their schedule by a factor
of 3.2 and another 31\% of software projects were cancelled before
completion~(\cite{standish95}). The estimated annual cost in the United
States for such software projects was \$100B.  b) Survey of members of
the British Computer Society found that only 130 of 1027 projects met
their schedule and budget. Half of all projects were maintenance or data
conversion projects and half new development projects, but the
successful projects divided into 127 of the former and just 3 of the
latter~(\cite{taylor00}). c) Survey of 250 large projects, each with the
equivalent of more than a million lines of C code, found similarly
disappointing results~(\cite{Jones04}). d) Survey listing just the large
examples of 50,000 projects, in that they cost at least \$10M in
development~(\cite{standish13}).  
 It has the most dismal outcomes,  suggesting that HealthCare.gov had just a 10\% chance of success.
