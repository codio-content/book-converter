Alan Perlis
  
  (1922--1990) was the first recipient of the Turing Award (1966), conferred
  
  for his influence on advanced programming languages and compilers.
  
  
  In 1958 he helped design ALGOL,
  
  which has influenced virtually every imperative programming language
  including C and Java.  To avoid FORTRAN's
  syntactic and semantic problems, ALGOL was the first language
  described in terms of a formal grammar, the eponymous
  _**Backus-Naur form**_ (named for Turing award
  
  
  winner Jim Backus and his colleague Peter Naur).
