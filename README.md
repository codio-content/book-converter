### First you need poppler-utils

pdftoppm and pdftocairo are the piece of software that do the actual magic. It is distributed as part of a greater package called [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).

Windows users will have to install [poppler for Windows](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/), then add the `bin/` folder to [PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

Mac users will have to install [poppler for Mac](http://macappstore.org/poppler/).

Linux users will have both tools pre-installed with Ubuntu 16.04+ and Archlinux. If it's not, run `sudo apt install poppler-utils`
